DoViP runs and then integrates the results from several virus analysis tools. These tools come with their own conda environments and databases. It is quite likely that the users have already installed these tools on their servers. As a result, I have decided not to include everything in a big conda environment, but rather to keep each tool in its own conda environment, separated from the conda environment of DoViP.
